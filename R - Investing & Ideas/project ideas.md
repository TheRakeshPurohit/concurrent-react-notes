**LMQL in JS**
- dont use streaming
	- because it is token by token and you need to run validation on the whole thing anyway?
		- https://docs.lmql.ai/en/latest/language/constraints.html#custom-constraints is eager
		- but that limits the kind of evals you can make
	- validate and use reflexion?
- use streaming 
	- people want to see output stream in
	- vercel streaming
- misc ideas
	- make testing framework using proxy where name of variable is the thing you will fuzz in unless there is some snapshot that makes everything deterministic

## devtools ideas

- error codes startup
	- "new stackoverflow"
	- every error should have a code, should have an immutable url, should have comments and decision tree
	- useful for sentry?
- i18n startup
	- nobody wants to do i18n
	- but everyone can throw money at it
	- annoying to templatize all the things
	- very impt to let readers contribute fixes easily
	- i18n with ai?
	- but not sure i care about this problem enough

"rippling of machine learning"
- parker conrad thesis https://youtu.be/H0c640t8dp0?t=5430

- this is back to front - there should be one digital twin of you that you grant permissions to every company
- isnt this google sso? basically yes? but bigger - take in all the other data
- maybe the api is "would you like this" and "from a scale of 1 to 5" or "x or y?"

project idea from mahmoud 
- yo random thought: why don't you make a course about finance for devs. it can have everything about how to know if a startup is most likely to fail/succeed, negotiating salary, calculating equity, etc. It can complete the Coding career handbook
- you can make a free resource and collect emails since it's not big in scope then
