interviewing and doing background checks for managers

- Instead of asking people if they "liked" their manager or not, get specific. 
	- * tell me about a hard conversation you had with them 
	- * how did people get promoted on this team? did it feel fair? 
	- * tell me about a time when the strategy changed and you had to abandon some hard work
- ask their peers:
	- * would you happily accept a transfer from the manager's team with no questions asked? or would you be wary of perf issues, level inflation, or values mismatch? 
	- * when your team needs something from theirs, do they respond? is there a process? 
	- * does the manager need to be involved in every little decision, or do the engineers run the show with a clear escalation path? 
	- * if escalated to, is the manager realistic about the team's ability to deliver? if they give an estimate, is it enough to unblock you? do they deliver?
- ask the manager's manager: 
	- * does the manager support people in resolving conflicts, or do it for them? 
	- * do their teams know why their work matters to the co? 
	- * are there success metrics where other teams can follow along? 
	- * do they amplify drama, or are they a drama dampener?
