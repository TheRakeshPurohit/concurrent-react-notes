What matters between co-founders - 

A few questions to ask them and yourself before you get started

  

Skills 

  

-   What skills does each co-founder bring to the table?
    
-   Are these skills complementary? 
    
-   Do you want to distribute functions and teams based on existing skills? Do people want to take over an area they are not expert in (ex., a marketer wants to be the finance lead)? What happens if, after a while, they don’t like it/ don’t perform in this area?
    
-   How proficient is each co-founder in their area of expertise? Are you able to assess that they are as good as they say? If not, have you talked to their former co-workers? Can you ask someone you trust that knows enough about their expertise to meet them and assess them? 
    
-   Will there be a CEO? Who will it be?
    
-   How will decisions be made? Who will make which decisions? How will we resolve disagreements? Will the CEO always have the final say?
    

  

Values

  

-   What drives you in life?   
    
-   How trusting are you when you don’t know someone?
    
-   What matters the most to you: customer satisfaction or profitability? 
    
-   Have you slept with former co-workers? What happened? 
    
-   Who is your best friend? Why do you love them? 
    

  

Aspirations

  

Personal

-   Why are you starting a business?
    
-   What keeps you up at night?
    
-   What is the best outcome with this business for you? How ambitious are you?
    
-   How much money do you want to make in the first few years / when it starts to scale / at exit if any? 
    
-   How much money can you invest in the business? How long can you live without a salary?
    
-   Do you have a life partner? Do you want one? 
    
-   Do you have kids? Do you plan to have kids in the next few years? How will it change your involvement in the business? 
    
-   What do you want your role to be in the first year? After a few years when it scales?
    
-   What is a perfect work day for you? What is the worst work day? How do you imagine your daily life if we start this company together? 
    

  

Business

-   Which metrics should the business achieve in the first year? In the first two years?
    
-   Do you want to bootstrap or raise money with investors? How many rounds would you like to raise? Do you know what a cap table is? 
    
-   What do you prefer: non-profitable high-growth or high profitability with smaller topline?
    
-   How will we split equity at foundation?
    
-   How do you define failure? What will it take for you to stop working on this business? What is the initial timeline for you to give it a go? 
    
-   What happens if one of the cofounders wants to stop and the other one wants to continue?
    

  
  

Age matters: people who are more than 5-10 years apart are usually in different life cycles and have different aspirations in terms of money / exit / lifestyles.

  

Personality

  

-   Tell me about your biggest business failure. What did you learn?
    
-   How extroverted are you? If introverted, how will it affect you as a co-founder when you will become a public figure? Are you willing to take on public-facing activities such as sales, recruitment, PR and investor relationships? 
    
-   Do you focus on the big picture or are you detail-oriented? How does this fit with the role you will have in the business ? (e.g., a very high-level person probably shouldn’t run ops)
    
-   If you have to choose between risk and safety, where do you go?
    
-   How do you set goals for yourself? How much in advance do you plan each week?
    
-   Do you believe in inbox zero? How do you organize your tasks and prioritize?
    
-   How do you learn on the role? How do you follow industry trends? What are the tech trends you are deeply interested in? 
    
-   Tell me the last time you didn’t know how to do something but had to do it anyway.
    
-   What are your weaknesses and strengths? How are you improving on them?
    
-   How do you deal with anxiety? Do you have habits/ a toolbox to deal with hard times? 
    
-   Do you prefer to be an individual contributor or a team leader? 
    
-   What has been your best work experience? Your worse? 
    
-   Are you optimistic or realistic?
    

  

You need to get a sense of where your potential co-founders are on the main areas of the MBTI and be able to deal with differences. There is no perfect personality to be a founder at an early-stage start-up but you definitely want to have people who have a growth mindset. They need to be equipped to deal with uncertainty and anxiety. 

  

Lifestyle 

  

-   How much do you work? 
    
-   Are you a morning or an evening person?
    
-   Do you work on the weekends?
    
-   Do you want to be in touch with your co-founders on the weekend? 
    
-   Do you prefer to work remotely or in person? Do you plan to be based in the same city all the time? Do you want to work in the office?
    
-   What happens if one of us wants to work fully remotely in the future? 
    
-   Do you party? Do you exercise? What are your hobbies outside of work?
    
-   Do you often plan holidays? Is it something you need / that matters to you?
    
-   How do you see the first two years of the company in terms of lifestyle?
    
-   Will you prioritize the company over everything else including your spouse/family/private life?
    
-   What is your daily routine outside of work?
    
-   What kind of boundaries would you like to establish?
    

  

Compatibility is key here, otherwise it will lead to fights and resentment, some co-founders will feel that their needs are not being met, that they work more than the others etc...

  

Culture

  

-   Have you worked in an early-stage company before? In a startup, in a scale up? 
    
-   Should there be an office? What will be our remote policy?
    
-   What will employee compensation be based on? 
    
-   How will we hire people? What kind of people do we want to hire?
    
-   What is a company culture for you? 
    
-   What do you want our company culture to be like? 
    
-   Will we implement processes to have a diverse workforce? Which ones?
    
-   Can you share 3 values that we should base our culture on? Explain concretely what they mean for you.
    

  

Management 

  

-   How do you manage people?
    
-   What does it take for you to trust them?
    
-   How many people have you managed in the past? Can I talk to someone you have managed? 
    
-   How do you hire people? Walk me through the process.
    
-   What happens if two people in your team don’t get along? How do you deal with it?
    
-   How do you give feedback to people? Have you established a process to give feedback? What is good feedback?
    
-   Would you rather micromanage or let people run wild on their own? 
    
-   What is the ideal organization? How many direct reports would you have? 
    
-   Do you implement weekly meetings with your team? If not, how do you ensure knowledge is shared? 
    
-   Should we allow meetings? How should we brainstorm on new ideas?
    
-   How should reporting be done? 
    

  

If it all works out, your co-founder will become a manager. Hiring and managing a team will be one of their main tasks. 

  

Fit to company

  

-   Are the skills each co-founder brings aligned with the company purpose? If not, how do you plan to cover for missing skills?
    
-   What are the key skills that are required in the specific industry/type of business you have chosen to be successful? (e.g., a consulting business requires amazing sales skills, an AI company requires advanced ML/data skills etc…)
    
-   Are you good enough in that line of work to make a difference?
    
-   Why you, why now, why this business?
    
-   Do you really care or are you excited by rational factors (e.g., size of industry, profitability levels,...)?
    
-   Would you do it if you had EUR10mn on your bank account? What would change?
    
-   What activities/tasks make you feel in the flow? Are these key to succeeding in the company you plan to build?
    

  
  

Communication / feedback 

  

-   What processes do we want to establish to make sure we share feedback between co-founders?
    
-   What kind of interactions do we want to have? Do we need daily / weekly / monthly touch points?
    
-   How do we share progress, problems and plans? How do we give transparency on what each team member is working on? 
    
-   What is the best piece of feedback you have received? Can you share a moment when someone shared negative feedback about your work performance? 
    
-   How will we share the workload? How will we share tasks that are at the border between two teams/co-founders?
    

  
  

Key to-dos

  

-   Have these hard and honest conversations before you get started
    
-   Don’t be afraid to disagree, disagreements only get worse when they are not discussed in the open air
    
-   Get reference checks on your co-founder(s)
