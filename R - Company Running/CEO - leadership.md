- Great people crave high standards, high performing teammates, personal growth, a sense of urgency, and winning.
- The natural instinct of most organizations is to be reactionary, incremental and unfocused. There is organizational gravity that continually lowers standards to the point of lowest friction, and to take less risk. It is extremely uncomfortable to push against this organizational gravity, to commit to do things when we don't know how we're going to achieve them.  
  But maintaining high standards and fighting incrementalism is perhaps the single most powerful thing a leader can do.

1/ "Leadership is a repeatable skill, not an art." Over 25 years ago, I attended a leadership session at Netscape, run by Jim Barksdale. It was a single hour that profoundly impacted my career. 
3/ Jim made it a point to differentiate leaders from managers. He stressed that all managers are not good leaders. Here are raw notes of Jim's breakdown of the most important qualities of effective leaders:

4/ Judgment. Logically weighing the facts to make a decision. Making sure you're technically qualified to decide.

5/ Bearing. It's a bit old-fashioned but favorable carriage and appearance, self-assured and controlled, showing flashes of humor and dignity.

6/ Decisiveness. Make decisions fast, bearing in mind the following guidelines 1) never make a decision you don't have to make 2) no decision is also a decision. "If you see a snake, kill it, don't play with dead snakes, all opportunities start out looking like snakes."

7/ Initiative. Do it now; you are the catalyst for action. The best leaders are those going 900 mph and looking like they are walking.

8/ Unselfishness. Help people out; be willing to pitch in when someone else needs it.

9/ Loyalty. Self-explanatory.

10/ Integrity. Honesty, endurance. On the latter, control your pace and rhythm; proving you can work long-term is more important than proving you can work 100 hrs/per week. Take good care of your physical health.

11/ Tact. Courtesy. Treating people the way you want to be treated.

12/ Courage. Fearlessness to accept criticism of yourself, take action, and make things better; always try to do better.

13/ Knowledge. Know your stuff.

14/ Enthusiasm. Go after it and enjoy what you're doing; remember that attitude is a performance problem.

15/ Dependability. If you're not dependable, it suggests that others around you aren't important enough. Not being dependable also suggests arrogance.

16/ Justice. Know the argument. Don't play favorites when it comes to justice; favoritism is one of the most debilitating attributes in a workplace.

17/ Jim's framing leadership as a developable skill gave me the confidence that I might be able to develop these qualities over time -- as long as I dared to accept criticism and had the drive to do better. I'm still working on it 25 years later. /end

Great summary of leadership from Shaan Puri:

_“If you want to be a leader, three things are true:_

_“**The first is that you have a higher standard for yourself than anybody else has for you**. So it doesn’t really matter what your job title is, but if you hold yourself to a higher standard than your manager holds you to, you are a leader._

_”**Second is somebody who understands what the emotional state is, and what it needs to be, and can transfer it**. So basically anybody that can understand that morale is low, it needs to be high. **They can shift the mood, they can shift the energy**. Or everybody’s a little too comfortable, we need to get a sense of urgency. They understand the emotional state and know how to shift it._

_”**The third is they see things how they actually are**. Not worse than they are, not better than they are, how they actually are. **And then they paint a picture of how it’s going to be better than it currently is**.”_ (Timestamp of quote 47:51-48:43)
