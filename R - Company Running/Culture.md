- **If you’re a founder evaluating yourself, consider asking:**
- What are my strengths?
- What am I outstanding at?
- What sets me apart from the people around me?
- What do I value about the people around me?
- When I look at my friends, what are the characteristics they have in common?
- What qualities drive me crazy about people
- How do I make my best decisions? (Think of a recent decision you made that had a good outcome. What process led to that?)
- What am I bad at?

When Facebook first started to grow, Mark Zuckerberg spent time asking other CEOs about some of the things they did early on at Microsoft, Apple, and others to establish culture and explain to people what it meant to work there. One of the best pieces of advice he got was to write down a succinct list of what it meant to be “one of us.”
It apparently took him 10 minutes, and he ended up with this list:
- A very high IQ
- Strong sense of purpose
- Relentless focus on success
- Aggressive and competitive
- High quality bar, bordering on perfectionism
- Likes changing and disrupting things
- New ideas on how to do things better
- High integrity
- Surrounds themselves with good people
- Cares about building real value over perceived value
