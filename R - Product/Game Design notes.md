After all, what do you spend most of your time doing while playing _Mario 64_?  
  
• Every 20+ hours: completing the game, defeating Bowser, getting all 120 stars  
• Every hour or two: completing a ‘boss’ battle  
• Every half an hour: getting access to a new area or painting  
• Every 5 minutes or so: completing an objective, getting a star  
• Moment to Moment: steering around, running, jumping, performing acrobatic maneuvers  
  
Breaking the game down by “granules” this way, it seems that _Mario 64_ is a game about feel. The thing you spend most of your time doing is moving Mario around, interacting through the controller at a tactile, kinesthetic level. It’s the fundamental activity of _Super Mario 64_ and it feels great. It has its quirks and input [ambiguities](http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/02/pushhing-buttons/), but this sensation is the foundation the rest of the game sits on.
