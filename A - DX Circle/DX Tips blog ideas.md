- forms of value
	- sending intros to journos
	- 
- work mentions into your talks and posts with disclosure
- ability to go from 0 to 100 is key
- ability to present your value in 30 mins is key
- ability to decide in short amount of time is key
	- price taker
- try to be known for your investments and founders you have helped, rather than going "i have money hit me up"
- equity advising > angel investing but really does take time

## what does well on HN

- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30070287
> Stripe succeeded on HN because they were favored by the _community_ for many years. They are one of a small number of startups who have reached what you could call 'community darling' status on HN. It's true that this is incredibly hard to do. Another startup that managed it, around the same time, was Cloudflare (not a YC startup). Startups achieve this by doing three things: producing products that the community considers good, producing articles that the community finds interesting, and mastering the art of interacting with the community. You need all three.

- your friends getting higher pay doing something else
- adhoc scripts
- one person doing the job holding all the context

- explaining benefits to later adopters
- vs explaining how it works to early adopters
- later adopters - no reason why not - pareto optimal - boring https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-big-data
- early: the tech is the story
	- cost doesnt matter
- late: the result is the story
	- cost optimisation

- the five chasms
	- founder - convincing yourself
	- hobbyists - theoretical + toy/fun
	- early adopter - feeling real pain
	- early majority - social proof
	- late majority - social pressure (staying up to date)
	- laggards - defaults
- avery pennarun on crossing chasm and market segmentation - must go to the same conferences https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tailscale-and-market-segmentation-with-avery-pennarun/id1514646781?i=1000563738841

react documentary
- pete hunt says the first react launch was too wide. too much new concepts incl jsx that people would react to
- second react launch was for the early adopters - hey we have cool ideas

- the reason open source launches appeal to devtools is because it targets early adopters who like to peek under the hood


figma - first figure out the feature, others offer the feature as product

https://adamnash.blog/2022/09/16/figma-a-random-walk-in-palo-alto/
- > More importantly, we believed that the history of desktop software contained clues to which types of software would be converted first: productivity applications (late 70s/early 80s), then enterprise applications, graphic design & desktop publishing, and finally personal finance
- As someone who had spent significant time in grad school on computer graphics, my initial reaction was very negative. In my mind, graphic design was incredibly compute intensive, to the point where professionals used highly optimized $10K workstations, multiple GPUs, and optimized data storage to get the local performance they desired.

https://readyset.io/blog/%5Bslug%5D 
- Our mission is to help developers build faster applications without writing extra code.
- ReadySet is building a SQL caching engine that sits in front of existing databases and dramatically improves database performance by accelerating reads. It supports millions of queries per second with sub-millisecond latencies on a single node, all while keeping cached state up-to-date automatically. Any time a write changes the data in the underlying database ReadySet automatically updates any affected cached query results. ReadySet is wire-compatible with MySQL and Postgres and can be used with existing applications without code changes. It is a simpler and more cost effective alternative to homegrown caching layers and read replica hierarchies. See our documentation for more information!

3. How do you choose what to work on? (blogging, internal evangelism, conferences, demos)
4. How important is experience with the technology you’re evangelizing?

6. Why would someone consider DevRel over engineering?



### developer content trade school

- The fundamental problem of developer content creation: "How to do React in 2021" gets 100x more views than "How to write software so you can maintain it for 10 years".
- The fundamental solution? write one paper with main thesis and then apply it a billion times

### a modest proposal for developer experience

lace everything with cocaine

### hard problems working on platforms
- stability work is zero value by default, justification comes from hard-to-reverse damage whereas feature work is overstated
- want to keep growing by adding features, but vast majority of users will just use three
- users you want to reach dont appreciate the problem you solve
	- supprot - pple blaming you for their problems 
- you want to commoditize complements/be switzerland but your users want a clear community
- extensibility and plugins - first x then y
- open source - users and operators
- multiple compile destinations
	- xbrowser difficulties https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1505401925184991235?s=21
	- lowest common denominators 
- https://skamille.medium.com/product-for-internal-platforms-9205c3a08142
	- But the platform team doesn’t build solutions for only one user. The whole value of a platform team is providing broadly-useful systems, so we are rarely presented with a well-specified need to fill.
	-  In a perfect world, platform product managers are regularly using the products they support in order to identify pain points and gaps that engineers might miss and users may not complain about. In the real world it’s hard to find time to use your products in anger when you are also dealing with all the other parts of the PM job.

## theory of value in devtools

cf sarah cataranzo convo

- alx rampell - "operating systems thesis" - system of truth
- value creation via economic leverage
- people replacement
- broken politics
- 3 layer cake - infra, platform, app 
- wardley map
- aggregation theory

- as seen  on TV
- how does it work?

- #1 problem of prefect is home grown solutions

- give develoeprs the tools to evaluate their own solutions
	- scheduler
	- retries
	- jitter
	- backfill
	- auth/permissions
	- secrets mgmt
	- etc


## growing UGC at devtools
- job postings
- case studies
- blogposts
- tweets

## devtools uncanny valley
- either small api surface area
- or extremely opinionated all in one
- in between require too much work for the value or are not flexible enough

## marketing to developers

- answer what's the catch
- hook into known hard problems eg cap theorem

## selling a programming paradigm
- fp vs oop
- sql vs nosql
- jamstack
- devops


## things developers want
- performance
- cost
- "scale"
- simplicity

## competing against DIY
