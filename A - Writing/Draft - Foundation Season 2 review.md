Episode 1
- Hari black and white monologue was very dramatic and cool, but we didnt actually see Gaal lock him in the Prime Radiant at all? i checked?
	- in fact in minute 37 Gaal then also says "I transferred him to the prime radiatn last night while you were sleeping" so was it 1 night or 138 years? what the fuck writers?
	- monologuing his way out of dimensions also kinda didnt work
	- how is 3d thing into 2d plane smart?
	- Kalle speaks in anapestic trimeter - really? really?
	- every attempt to be smart here is pretty dumb man
- Gaal and Salvor awkward meeting is good given thats what they were going for
	- dive scene was cool and reckless i guess but had no stakes bc you knew they would make it
	- Hari anger vs Gaal therefore wasnt earned bc also he had to go help the ship immediately later
- Cleon/Day Blind Angels assassination fight was extremely good opener, Demerzel in bed had real shock value and established time skip
	- Lee Pace yelling his lines when healing without anaesthesia was also FANTASTIC lol
	- "utter the word rest and you die". "somebody get me a damn blasted robe" so amazing
	- instant killing his shadowmaster this time but not last season when the plot on Dawn was uncovered - establishes a much more brutal Day this time around
- Terminus 
	- setting up the time bomb of the Invictus on Terminus and having the huntress cameo again was great
	- introducing Magicians verbally which we later see doing the feats Demerzel mentions - nice touch
	- Dusk saying "crush them" and Demerzel disagreeing is interesting... esp since Day ends up trying to do exactly that
- Marriage/queen sareth introduction
	- Day mentions drifting further from the genetic origin... but then in episode 2 they mention that they're only like 3 "centimorgans" off which really doesnt make this seem all that serious, they all know they're off anyway
	- Sareth immediately coming in and questioning everything establishes her intelligence and personality but is really poor strategy given she's already being referred to as "future empress"

Episode 2
- the Hari vs Gaal anger still feels off. Hari still mumbling like a madman which I guess is the point
	- ship flying off into the sky was beautiful
	- nobody cares why Gaal kept Hari from second foundation bc i guess she starts it in this season
	- Gaal having The Mule vision is impt for the story I guess but we dont really fear the Mule enough. putting a clock on Salvor is a cool plot point tho
	- Getting the name of Ignis just from the Mule - which is basically going to be the home of the second foundation - seeemd kinda stretched but ok. 
	- Tellem's ESP voice can reach "almost a parsec"? 
- Beki and Constant! goodboi
	- we still dont really know why the Siwenna people seem to have strung up a Claric?
	- introducing the Poly and Constant dynamic early on, fantastic banter
	- magic show from Poly was great
	- showing how advanced their jump ship technology is vs season 1's empire ships was also fantastic
- Introducing Bel Riose - well done introduction via Day and Demerzel and Dusk
- the Cleons all having to take movement classes is a nice contrast to season 1 when it was just assumed. and the Day rejecting it shows he is the bigger anomaly vs the current Dawn and Dusk folding their arms in sync.
	- Sareth continuing to question Day publicly is both dumb and sharp. and immediately hitting on Dawn, also dumb. 
- constant theme of memory editing and doubt is interesting
- Terminus
	- why does the Warden have such a strong american accent when everyone else is somewhat english
	- reveal that Poly is the kid from end of season 1 was kinda cool
	- how exactly did Terminus develop such strong tech all over the place in only 138 years? flying? jumpships? castling?
	- "You can say a homily" - such great tension
	- "I believe in the Prophet" "Which way do you spell it?" nice burn
	- Warden is kind of an egotistical ass for not letting Poly be first but he was a believer. his grandiose speech was paid back immediately tho. how does Hari get him to say "get Hober Mallow"? science magic i guess

Episode 3
- Going to Oona's World to make Hari a real boy again. just a weird unexplained thing that we'll see next season i guess
	- the "not alive but not alone" reveal of big machine spiders is great
- nice Poly and Constant convo introducing Hober Mallow 
	- great castling gambit to start, introduces castling which is never used again til the finale
	- second one also great though he cut it close enough to actually kill the guy if the Titan prick wasn't stopped
	- instant chemsitry with Constant was also nice
- finally introducing Bel Rios!
	- he's weirdly too defensive of his fellow prisoners yet? but establishes him as a good guy
	- Day testing Bel Rios 1:1 was good too. Bel Rios had his priorities right, made Day happy but still said what he thought
	- acting with Glawen was just sublime. sadness, joy, relief, love, embarrassment, despair.
	- Reveal of the cleaned up General was great, his presence in the room sa he walked into the command center of his ship
	- spaceship scenes were gorgeous

Episode 4

Episode 5
- Raych cameo was finely acted
- multiple hallucinations of Raych and then of Hugo made all appearances quite suspect
- Secret meetings of Sareth and Rue seem too public
	- Rue backstory with now-Dusk was sweet - Rue's opening convo was very well written
		- "Me? I refuse to look up from my game"
	- just asking the librarian for a memory audit of the assassination attempt and getting it from someone directly in the room was too easy lol. shit security
- Demerzel fist pump and Day engagement were funny! 
	- Sareth crying as she offered herself but also obviously looking around is very on theme for her established character
	- Day not knowing how to be with a non robot was also very well established
	- "the people closest to you ARE you"
	- "excuse me empire but I am NOT reassured"
	- sareth is amazing
- Cleon I being unsympathetic to Dawn and Dusk was kinda on brand
	- mention of the green = traitor link is good foreshadowing
	- telling Dawn to get a life and love is also great foreshadowing
	- another weird unit - "cataphyls of memory". 213 for Cleon I vs 80something for the average Cleon - makes it weirdly quantitative? and means current Day is also subject to it
- Meeting Tellem - the little girl trick seemed unnecessary
	- but revealing that they are very very good mind readers - reading their names, their prime radiant, and cloning Hugo from Gaal's POV was a good intro of their skills

Episode 6
- young hari bowl cut - what the fck? nobody is buying that lol
- Hari math on herd movement is so contrived... and such a hamfisted way to make his revenge on Dr Tarj rhyme. Her motivations to kill Yanna were also briefly explained as survivalism but not really sold. Yanna was instantly charming though but its hard to get past the Hari bowl cut. it's nice to see a less arrogant Hari pre Yanna though.
- we're not really sure why Poly and Constant are on Trantor, we're not sure why they're let in and then captured (update: oh this is addressed in ep 7)
	- monologue on belief vs faith is pretty nice... but idk if faith is that much more powerful
- Tellem teaching and confronting Gaal was cool and telling her mostly true things but she doesnt seem super trustworthy - why reveal herself as a manipulator so early
- Hober Mallow briefly meeting the Spacer Home Swarm was visually there but too brief
- Sareth making some publicpopulist pledge at her wedding that was never referenced again? Who cares about her popularity?
- Would Cleon I have wanted to give any Day the power to singlehandedly end the Genetic Dynasty? seems like a weakness.
- Tellem v Hari doesnt work because its all mental and explained thru words
- "the gods made wine" quote - what was that again? cant remember but seemed impt for title


Episode 7
- more Sareth being awesome
	- "I can argue in any position" with the doctor's head between her legs
	- crying as Demerzel threatens her in her very lonely position
	- Sareth lashing out to Day, saying she knows he killed her family. well acted
	- seducing Dawn and having his baby is smart
- more Tellem teaching and being a savior of her community
	- Gaal motivational speaking to the community is a sudden jump - but Salvor being visibly uncomfortable with it is cool
- Hober setting up Spacer side quest and Opalesk plot point gets later payoff... but then the Spacer leader seems to reject the offer at first? very confusing. then they show up to hand over Hober Mallow to Bel Rios
	- Hober setting Beki loose and then jumping away - was it planned, or not? wtf?
	- Bel Rios breaking down everything for Empire afterward shows why he's such a great soldier
	- Bel Rios vs Glawen argument shows how deeply Bel Rios understands the empire's situation and why he follows Empire anyway because lawlessness is worse
- Constant revealing Hari Seldon back in the throne room was a nice taunt but i'm not sure what that was meant to achieve - I guess that Day is obsessed by Hari and psychohistory and doing everything incl ending the genetic dynasty in order to subvert Hari
	- interesting choice for Day's two hand thing to mean electrocute Constant rather than kill her
	- great setup for their "execution" later
- Salvor diverging from Gaal and warning her she's not a savior, finding out how she is being blinded - great individual characterization
	- k so Hari is shown to die by drowning in last episode and now Salvor also shown to die by drowning trying to save Hari but then turns out they both survive somehow? death doesnt mean anything in this show lol

Ep 8 - the last empress
- people reviewed this very well
- Rue revealing that they can undo memory erases
	- Dusk repeating "She will always be here" - "You're as programmed as demerzel is"
- Tellem acknowledging she killed Hari to Gaal and locking her in the muzzle pit
	- it's true she's "on an accelerated timeline"
	- then later revealing Salvor to also be in a similar pit is just visually confusing
	- Salvor found the other radiant awfully fast lol and its awfully intact
	- was this the first time Salvor activates the Radiant?
	- Terminus-Hari doing chain of thought to deduce he's the "left hand" and the inferior copy was great
		- "an experiement... which it kind of is"
		- "fuuuck. i'm the left hand" lol
		- figuring out how to Radiant-facetime back was also smart
		- the reveal that he got the Hober Mallow name from Salvor and the two foundation stories are time shifted was a nice one - on the podcast they said they figured it out only much later after ep 2. writing is vertically arranged but appears horizontal
- Poly and Constant execution was touching
	- but broadcasting it to empire was really dumb when the vulnerable girl was saying her prayers. her father, watching the broadcast, was a cynic of the church, but as she said her prayers started echoing the words too. "guide me through the darkness"
	- "we let our future empress choose" - Day already playing cruel games with Sareth after giving up on romancing her. later she makes out with him and he gets all serious about her wedding again lol.
	- hober mallow heroism so established you can cheer for him
	- Beki attack on Day was awesome and his terror was amazing but nothing seemed to come from that fear later
	- THE TENSION as he gets her collar off
	- Day continuing
		- "I'm going to Terminus"
- Rue confronting Sareth about the Dawn connection is so well played. they trust each other and fight like sisters.
	- "Wife and widow are both called Empress."
- The Mayor having a 1:1 with Hari after he refused to show for the Warden was really nice
	- "You tell me she'll survive and I'll believe you. If that were so you wouldve chosen the robes"
- Hober and Constant - conversation was so natural and heartfelt
	- yay for Constant seizing the moment with Hober!
	- "lets promise to always attend each other's executions" lol
	- and starting the name guessing game with Hober
- Poly and Day - talking about the Second Crisis, compariing Day and Seldon's immortality
	- "You think you've taken on the trappings of religion, but once you start thinking and praying, it's hard to standing and thinking"
- Gaal vs Tellem scene on tablet
	- "its me who planted the ssed inside your head (to leave Synnax)"
	- scary. Her last secret that she didnt tell Gaal. terrifying
- "Demerzel is Cleon's only true heir"

Ep 9 - Long ago and Far away

- origins of Demerzel and Cleon 1 - a beautiful meeting and story 
	- tasteful nudity used by Demerzel
	- "Time enough to break his neck... but she did not.. and with that choice, she lost everything"
	- immediately tries to kiss her, and make her loyal to him
	- she cries
	- "This is not freedom"
	- "How I wish I'd asked you before I made it compulsory."
- Gaal vs Tellem scary ritual - interrupt is earned by Salvor throwing the distruptor things
- Bel Rios vs Hober - very nice meeting of the 2 new breakout characters
	- "My dead man's bigger than yours?"
- "I will be the Cleon that chose Peace"
- Poly demoing Day
