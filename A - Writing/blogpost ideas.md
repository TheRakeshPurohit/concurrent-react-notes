# blogpost ideas



## B plot vs A plot

humans are bad at slow moving train wrecks
base effects
https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1652708537846632449


## founder vs manager

frontline manager is helping team
middle manager is playing The Game
founder js going 0 to 1

not super helpful to be in bigtech as founder


The Game
- 9boxes
- Leadership, Leverage, Impact

L1 - impact on yourself
L3 - member of the staff
L7 - industry


## the great consolidation

first layoffs 
now mergers and acquisitions


## the ties that bind

metaverse has no interop 
cloudflare bandwidth alliance
google android

ml alliances

\

## startup vs upstart 

- hire fast vs hire right
- time based vest vs milestone based vest
- raise big vs raise often
- apply sales playbook vs be a strategic challenger
- long backlog vs shape up/motivation/opportunistic


## business models i like
let non x do x
- turn non x into professionals 
- being the "home" for the profession, inventiong the profession
	- analytics engineer

unbundling
- itunes: turn the bundle into individual songs
- toyota: turned waterfall into JIT
- shein: fast fashion
- aws: cloud
- data -> unbundling metrics layer https://pedram.substack.com/p/what-is-the-metrics-layer

creator economy
- help people make money and take a tax
- build marketplace, two sided economy

virtualize anything + write compiler/OS for it
- react
- snowflake
- turborepo

write a special purpose database
- store stuff
- compute/query
- have a well known schema


cloudflare
- pain button -> CDN/DDOS


own something central
- auth
- logging & tracing
- metrics
- feature flags
- dependency injection? https://youtu.be/zrNr3JVUc8I?t=1330

own a part of the company or the place in the 3 financial statements
- stripe - revenue
- brex/ramp - expense
- rippling - employees


- stage 2
	- come for content stay for community
	- marketplace


## components of cloud

space power and connectivity

## writing value chain

- tiago forte creator labs podcast
- CODE
- Source
	- doing projects
	- talking to others
	- 

## angel investing your time

transcribe and expand upon educative podcast

hollowed out company https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1536400914486943745?s=20&t=62LMwMZXTyu-1v8pXViAqQ

## the problems orchestration solves

- overlapping crons
- minimum latency


## unknown idea

anyway the main point is that a few notable metaframeworks have started placing bets for a framework agnostic future. wont be an earnest reality until the preceding few points also become unbundled.

Your Brain on Success Porn:
- Success Porn gets you to 80/20 everything and 100% nothing
- Success Porn makes you believe you can skip the foreplay of relationship building with the right idea, the right quote, the right mental model
- The Regret Minimization Framework sounds smart because what they actually minimize is how much they say about their real regrets
- Success Porn is shot from the POV of the one character that has the best outcome, sidelining others
- Success Porn sells billionaire advice to thousandaires and, when they fail, blames *them* for not believing hard enough
- Success Porn twists your definition of success to someone else’s definition of success, so your sense of self worth is subject to how much someone else thinks you are worth
- Success Porn makes you compare others’ highlight reels vs your CCTV.

Let me present the Paige Compositor. A typesetting machine if you like, made from 18,000 precision made parts in 1877. Well, 1877 is the start year of the contract. The project went on for about 15 years. 6 machines were ever made (out of 4,000 ordered). They kept failing.

Meanwhile, a much more limited (initially) machine arrived on the scene, the Linotype machine. It was successfull and did run the world's news and magazine press for the next 100 years.

It's really a fascinating read: [https://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2023/03/the-machine...](https://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2023/03/the-machine-that-bankrupted-mark-twain/)

### software from first principles
stages of software engineering
general theory of software systems


https://tailscale.com/blog/modules-monoliths-and-microservices/
> Depending which branch of programming you go down, you then discover recursive functions, combinators, static function prototypes, libraries (statically or runtime-linked), objects (OOP), coroutines, protected virtual memory, processes, threads, JITs, namespaces, sandboxes, chroots, jails, containers, virtual machines, supervisors, hypervisors, microkernels, and [unikernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel).
> 
   And that's just the boxes! Once you have boxes isolated from each other, then you need to connect them with arrows. For that, we have ABIs, APIs, syscalls, sockets, RPCs, filesystems, databases, message passing systems, and "virtualized hardware."

security
- why cant u just run shit as root?
- behold the package manager
- apt get install
- and git and docker

# throw catch considered harmful
- catch consolidates errors by default. keep errors local and automatically separated
- theres no way to mark the difference between error and exception
- common practice to rethrow errors so you have no idea where the error came from
	- cannot nest errorarray
	- cannot add metadata

Tech Ethics
- Designing for Crisis https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/25/designing-for-crisis-design-for-real-life/ 
- If we believe that technology is powerful, then we must also believe that the people who wield it have a responsibility for that power. The medical industry has the Hippocratic Oath, commonly interpreted as “First do no harm”. The closest version we have is “the Computer Lib Pledge” articulated by Ted Nelson in 1974:
- https://ethicalos.org/
- Deontology vs Utilitarianism
- Deontology: the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the action.
- Consequentialism: the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct.
- Preaching ethics to others

technology fundamentalism
- Innovations in social scalability involve institutional and technological improvements that move function from mind to paper or mind to machine, lowering cognitive costs while increasing the value of information flowing between minds, reducing vulnerability, and/or searching for and discovering new and mutually beneficial participants. 
- Alfred North Whitehead said, “It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” 
- Friedrich Hayek added: “We make constant use of formulas, symbols, and rules whose meaning we do not understand and through the use of which we avail ourselves of the assistance of knowledge which individually we do not possess. We have developed these practices and institutions by building upon habits and institutions which have proved successful in their own sphere and which have in turn become the foundation of the civilization we have built up.”

## strategy moonshots

## Combinatorial Optionality

A book Jeff had us read, one which he said should serve as an inspiration for how we'd design AWS, was Creation: Life and How to Make It by Steve Grand. It's a book about programming artificial life, but the core principle that Jeff wanted us to take from it was the idea that complex things like life forms are built from very simple building blocks or primitives. It's the same thesis as that in Stephen Wolfram's A New Kind of Science.

The key implication for AWS from the book was about how to design the first AWS primitives. Jeff urged us to include only what was necessary and nothing more. If you were designing a storage service, like S3, you'd need functions like get, write, delete, but you wouldn't want to layer in things that weren't part of storage, like security. That should be a separate primitive.
