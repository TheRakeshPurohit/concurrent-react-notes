2005 - It is amusing that in 2005, "VLDB" (precursor term to "big data") was defined in Wikipedia to be "larger than 1TB".. after reading through the post and the author's experience.. it would appear that this was not actually a completely terrible estimate, although there are larger and smaller: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Very_large_database&oldid=20738417) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34702050

	- In the beginning of our story, back in the '70s, there were [Codd's rules,](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-in-a/9780596155322/ch01s01s01.html) defining what we now call "[relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database)", also known today as "databases". You know them, even if you don't: all data lives in tables; tables have columns, and rows are addressable with keys; C.R.U.D.; schemas; a textual language to convey these concepts. The language, of course, is SQL, which prompted a Cambrian explosion of SQL databases, from Oracle to DB2 to Postgres to MySQL, throughout the '80s and '90s.
	- It hasn't all been good. The 2000s got us XML databases. But our industry atoned by building some [great columnar databases](https://www.vertica.com/secrets-behind-verticas-performance/) during the same time. By the 2010s, we saw dozens of large-scale, open-source distributed database projects come to market. Now anyone can spin up a cluster and query terabytes of data.
	- First came the database tier. Later, with [memcached](https://memcached.org/) and [Redis](https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/redis.io), we got the caching tier. We've got [background job tiers](https://sidekiq.org/) and we've got [routing tiers](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) and distribution tiers.

- https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-big-data first-wave big data companies like Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR, hyped the same narrative: We have tons of data, and we’re going to change the world with it.
	- https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-big-data/comment/5957489?s=r
	- I'll age myself by saying that I remember Impala, and also was at the first Databricks Strata tutorial circa 2014. I started using both Databricks and Snowflake relatively early on--2016/2017. And while I love, love, LOVE your posts, I think there's one thing you get wrong here. Before roughly 2019, Databricks wasn't at all "a big, fast database that you can write SQL and Python against." Yes, you could query tables with SQL, but all of the underlying stuff you had to do with s3 and cluster management made it feel a lot more like Hadoop than Redshift or Snowflake. So much so that my DS/ML teams used Databricks because we liked python, but it was totally infeasible to make our Analytics team use it instead of Snowflake.
	- That all changed in 2020 when Databricks released Delta and very slowly integrated it into their product offering. Delta is basically OSS Snowflake, and since then, Databricks and Snowflake have been slowly converging. Finally in the last year or so Delta feels a lot like Snowflake (with a nice UI, simplified SQL clusters like Snowflake warehouses, etc.). So it really is a big, fast database that you can program with python, scala, SQL.

## analytics engineering

- https://www.getdbt.com/state-of-analytics-engineering-2023/
	- In January of 2019, Michael Kaminsky, writing for Locally Optimistic, hit publish on a blog post titled [The Analytics Engineer](https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/). The blog post described how new tools were enabling any analyst who knew SQL to manage code bases and contribute to the data development process. The blog post perfectly named an experience that many data practitioners were having at the time.
	- 2021: Two years later, Seth Rosen infamously claimed: [An analytics engineer is really just a pissed off data analyst](https://www.hashpath.com/2020/12/an-analytics-engineer-is-really-just-a-pissed-off-data-analyst/). And 18 months after that, analytics engineers made the mainstream press. [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/data-analytics-engineer-dbt-tech-job-salary-skills-needed-2022-5) covered the rising salaries of this emerging role, stating that companies like Amazon and Apple were hiring for the desirable skill-set.
